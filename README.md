Task SandwichðŸ¥ª was created as our final project during our coding bootcamp. During the bootcamp, we realized one of the biggest struggles we were having was adequate communication and organization of larger-scaled projects. The purpose for creating this site was to address those issues while also delivering a fun reward system to keep people engaged. To that end, we created that rewards system based on sandwiches (i.e. if a member of the project works enough, they can recieve "sandwiches" to use as credits for rewards in real life). 

While still a work in progress, due to the complexity of this project, we really enjoyed overcoming the challenged brought up during this project. Our goals, while ambitious, allowed us to practice everything we learned throughout the bootcamp plus more. We realized the complexity and score of real world projects through this project. While this project is not finished yet, we do believe the work done on this project is high level

## Usage
---

On page load, users will be taken to the homepage. The title at the top of the page is a link back to the homepage. Underneath that is the navbar, which contains the log-in or sign-up buttons. To use this site the user must be signed in. On sign-in, user data will be securely encrypted in the Task Sandwich database, at which point the user will then on only have to log in using their credentials.

At the bottom of the page, in the footer, the user will find links to: 
- our README
- the Code of Conduct
- Security info
- the License
- as well as links to our social media profiles and Github reopository for this project

Once logged in, the navbar will change to display log out button, as well as buttons to profile page and projects page.

On the profile page, the user will be presented their personal user information, including: 
- profile name
- teams the user belongs to
- projects the user is assigned to
- tasks the user is assigned to
- a calendar to dispaly tasks by day

On the projects page, the users will get a more details description of the projects and tasks assigned to each project. This information is displayed per team. So each team is shown in descending order and displays each project similarly, showing tasks that are incomplete, in progress, and completed.
